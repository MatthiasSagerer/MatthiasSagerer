### Biological neural network learning to build artificial ones. ðŸ¤–

```python
def reachGoal(goal):
    target = defineMeasurableTarget(goal)
    approach, result = firstTry()
    while (result != target):
        insights = reflect(approach, result, target)
        approach, result = iterate(insights, approach, result, target)
    print(f"Achieved goal with {result}")
