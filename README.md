### Direction
*"Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."* <br>
<div style="text-align: right">– Steven Paul Jobs</div>

### Focus
*"Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is the noble art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials."* <br>
<div style="text-align: right">– Lin Yutang</div>

### No Regrets
*“You have one life. Just one. How bad do you want to make it worth it?”* <br>
<div style="text-align: right">– Unknown</div>

### Resilience
*“You're using the excuse of passion to disguise your inability to tolerate hardness.”* <br>
<div style="text-align: right">– Alex Hormozi</div>

### Ambition
*"The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them."* <br>
<div style="text-align: right">– Michelle Obama</div>

### Consistency
*"Without commitment, you’ll never start. But more importantly, without consistency you’ll never finish. [...] Keep working, keep striving, never give up, fall down seven times, get up eight. Ease is a greater threat to progress than hardship. So, keep moving, keep growing, keep learning. See you at work."* <br>
<div style="text-align: right">– Denzel Washington</div>

### Action
*“If you see a way to make progress at achieving something you really want, do it now. Right now might be the best conditions for it that there’ll ever be. Can you do it or will you actually do it? It ought to feel uncomfortable. That’s a sign that you grow.”* <br>
